# MachineLearning-FinalTeamwork
Final semester teamwork in the discipline "Machine Learning and Big Data". Creating a model for determining the tone of posts.

The project is dedicated to developing a machine learning model for automatically determining the emotional coloring (positive or negative) of Russian-language posts on Twitter or other social networks. Two marked-up datasets containing positive and negative messages, respectively, are provided as source data. The main task is to create and train an effective tonality classification model capable of demonstrating high accuracy on new text data.
The following key tasks are being solved within the framework of the project:
− analysis and formation of the dataset structure with the selection of the most significant features;
− preprocessing of text using modern methods of purification, lemmatization and normalization;
− thematic modeling to identify characteristic words and themes in positive and negative messages;
− vectorization of texts for subsequent training of models;
− training and evaluation of the effectiveness of several classification algorithms;
− expansion of the training program in
